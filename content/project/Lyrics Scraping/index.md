This project aimed, above all, to stretch my web scraping skills while having some fun. The final result was a dataset of song lyrics from 6 musical genres scraped from the [Vagalume](https://www.vagalume.com.br/). The dataset can be used for analyses at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/neisse/scrapped-lyrics-from-6-genres). I also detailed how i obtained the data (with code in R) in [this post](https://www.aneisse.com/post/20190210-music-data-scraping/20190210-music-data-scraping/).
