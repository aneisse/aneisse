# Biography

</style>

Statistician, programming adept and an enthusiast of science, I’m currently focused on specializing in Statistics, R Programming and Data Science. I’ve got intermediate knowledge of VBA (Excel) and SQL, as well as basic knowledge of Python (for now).

Most of my analyses will be hosted at Kaggle and you can see them at my [account page](https://www.kaggle.com/neisse) within the “Kernels” section. However, there are some analyses that won’t fit Kaggle’s site, like the ones in which the dataset can’t be shared, or even some posts that don’t involve analysis at all. These types of analyses will be shared here on this blog.
