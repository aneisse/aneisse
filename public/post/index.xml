      <description>Today I woke up with a desire to stretch my web scraping skills and willing to do so while listening to some music, so why not scrap some music data? In this post I will scrap som data on artists and their lyrics so in a future post I plan on having some visualizations on the data as well as train a LSTM on the lyrics and maybe make it compose some new ones!</description>

      <description>Before anything else, I tried HARD to make tabsets work with blogdown but it doesnâ€™t offer support to tabsets at all, nor folded code chunks, sadly. That said, this post might look longer than it really is! Unless you want to read every chunk of code, then it indeed IS as long as it seems.
