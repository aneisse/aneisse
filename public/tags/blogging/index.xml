      <description>Welcome to my blog!As you may already know (or not), my name is Anderson Neisse, I am a statistician and an enthusiast of natural sciences and technology. In fact, the only thing that kept me from graduating at physics instead of statistics was the fact that statistics and data analysis are the most awesome things in this world (and the fact that I like programming, of course)!
Well, apart from that, I like to analyze interesting data, especially the ones with potential to underline amazing behaviours.</description>
